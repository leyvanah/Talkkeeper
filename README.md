</p>

An entirely free, fully unlocked fork of [Meetily](https://github.com/Zackriya-Solutions/meetily). Every feature is available without an account, subscription, license key, trial, or paid tier.

[Download for Windows](https://github.com/TylerBuza/Meetily-ActuallyFree/releases/latest) · [Download for macOS Apple Silicon](https://github.com/TylerBuza/Meetily-ActuallyFree/releases/tag/v0.2.5-macos)

This fork also goes beyond removing feature restrictions. It adds speaker identity, separate mic and system audio, automatic meeting detection, people profiles, richer exports, a redesigned interface, dedicated Windows and Apple Silicon installers, and numerous recording and reliability improvements.

## Interface

## Latest Release

Meetily `v0.2.12` preserves user-renamed meetings during summary generation,
restores summary template and model controls, synchronizes meeting titles, and
anchors meeting and transcript times to the actual recording start.

## Highlights

- **Speaker-aware transcripts:** mic speech stays `You`; remote voices become `Speaker N`; overlap can render as `You + Speaker 1`.
- **Split audio pipeline:** microphone and system audio are VAD-processed and transcribed independently, while aligned source tracks are retained beside the mixed playback file.
- **Live source visualization:** separate mic and system meters show pre-mix activity throughout recording.
- **Floating recording bar:** shrink the main window into a compact minibar with a synchronized timer and pause, resume, stop, and restore controls.
- **Automatic meeting detection:** watches locally for Zoom, Teams, Slack, Webex, and other meeting apps, then prompts you to start recording.
- **Overhauled interface:** a cohesive dark-first theme across recording, transcripts, summaries, people, and settings, with light mode available.
- **Universal Windows setup:** one installer selects NVIDIA CUDA, Vulkan, or CPU and packages required runtimes.
- **Better post-call processing:** retranscribes retained mic/system tracks independently before diarization and summary.
- **Meeting memory:** global search, reusable people profiles, speaker naming, and grounded person Q&A.
- **Native exports:** PDF, DOCX, Markdown, text, JSON, or clipboard.
- **Resilient local models:** resumable, validated downloads with Parakeet mirror fallback.
- **Whisper vocabulary hints:** teach live and post-call transcription recurring names, acronyms, products, and meeting-specific terms.
- **Private updates and no telemetry:** Windows update checks are opt-in, and analytics transmission is disabled on every platform.

## Install

### Windows

1. Download `Meetily-ActuallyFree-*-universal-setup.exe` from the [latest release](https://github.com/TylerBuza/Meetily-ActuallyFree/releases/latest).
2. Run setup. It selects CUDA, Vulkan, or CPU automatically.
3. Complete first-launch model setup.

Windows 10/11 x64 is supported. The installer is unsigned, so SmartScreen may
show **Unknown publisher**.

### macOS Apple Silicon

1. Download `Meetily-Actually-Free_0.2.5_aarch64.dmg` from the [macOS release](https://github.com/TylerBuza/Meetily-ActuallyFree/releases/tag/v0.2.5-macos).
2. Open the DMG and drag **Meetily - Actually Free** to Applications.
3. Grant microphone and Audio Capture permissions when prompted.

M1 and newer Macs running macOS 14.2 Sonoma or later are supported. The DMG is not Apple-notarized, so first launch may require Control-clicking the app and selecting **Open**. Both releases include SHA-256 checksums.

The current macOS 0.2.5 artifact passed automated Apple Silicon packaging and
launch checks, but physical macOS 14.2 capture qualification is still pending.
Treat it as a preview and verify recordings before relying on it for critical
meetings.

## Local Data

| Data | Location |
| --- | --- |
| Database, templates, and models | Windows/Linux: install-local when writable; macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Meetily` |
| Recording/onboarding preference stores | macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/com.meetily.ai` |
| Recordings | Windows: `Music/meetily-recordings`; macOS: `Movies/meetily-recordings`; configurable in Settings |
| Playback and retained tracks | `audio.mp4`, `mic.mp4`, `system.mp4` |

Use **Settings → General → Data Storage Locations** or **Settings → Recording →
Save Location** to choose another writable recordings folder.
Meetily validates the destination before saving it and keeps core app data in
the platform-specific location above.

## Password And Keys

**Settings → Security** puts a password in front of the archive. What it does
today, and what it does not, stated plainly:

- The password never becomes the key the data is encrypted with. It derives a
  key-encryption key through **argon2id**, which wraps a separate random data
  key. Changing the password rewraps 32 bytes; it does not rewrite the archive.
- A **recovery code** can wrap that same data key in a second envelope. It is
  offered by default and shown exactly once. Without it, a forgotten password
  means the archive cannot be opened by anyone, including you.
- **Locking wipes the key from memory** rather than covering the window. The
  archive locks when idle — never during a recording, because the key is what a
  recording writes with — and a recording cannot be started while locked.
- Guesses are throttled: three are free, then the wait doubles up to five
  minutes, and the count survives closing the app.
- The keys live in `keystore.json` beside the database. It holds no secret in
  the clear; copying it gains an attacker nothing but the right to guess.

**What is not yet covered.** At this stage the password gates access *through
the app*. The recording files and the database are not yet encrypted at rest —
that is the next step. Until then, someone with the disk can read them exactly
as before.

**Boundaries that will remain after that step.** The key sits in the memory of a
running process: cold-boot attacks, swap files, crash dumps and a live operating
system already unlocked by you are outside what this protects against. It
defends the disk, not the machine while you are using it.
